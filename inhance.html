        <p>This project involved research, planning, designing, and prototyping of mobile application. </p>
        <p><b>My Role:</b> UX/UI Designer
        <br><b>Tools Used:</b> Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, InVision, Miro/RealTimeBoard, Trello
        <br><b>Timeframe:</b> 2 weeks</p>
        <br>

        <h1>The Problem:</h1>

        <img src="images/Inhance/empty-room.jpg" class="smallerImage">
        <br>
        <p>When faced with an empty room, one may not know how to furnish it. Not everyone is an interior designer and not everyone plans out their rooms down to the details, which results in sometimes messy and inconsistent layouts.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>Inhance is a platform that helps users bring to life a vision for their living space. By incorporating planning, shopping, and sharing into one app, users can experience a simpler way to interior design.</p>
        <img src="images/Inhance/mockups.png" class="wideImage">
        <br>


        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>User interviews and surveys were conducted in order to gain insight into how users plan their room layouts and what specific tools they use to do so.</p>
        <img src="images/Inhance/researchData.png" class="smallerImage">
        <p>Results showed that a majority of users actually have a vision or plan of some sort for a layout, but do not plan it out in detail. Users either used pen and paper to plan or no tool at all, suggesting that there is a need for a room layout planning tool. Additionally, some users had a lack of experience in interior design, and would either seek assistance or only buy essentials for their rooms.</p>
        <br>


        <h1>User Persona</h1>
        <p>Using data from the interviews and survey responses, the following persona was generated to stay oriented towards user needs and frustrations throughout the design process. This persona represents a user who is moving into a new apartment for his first time, but is unaware of how he should design the layout.</p>

        <h1>Competitor Analysis</h1>
        <p>
        The main competitors consisted of the website Floor Planner, the apps amikasa and IKEA Place, and regular pen and paper. Based on user research, pen and paper was used the most, followed by IKEA Place. The other competitors were not used, either due to lack of knowledge about them or their costs. The goal of Inhance is to provide as many features as possible while being at least as accessible as IKEA Place by providing free services.
        </p>

        <h1>Sketches and Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>The following low-fidelity wireframes were made for the app, incorporating as many features as planned. Inhance was intially intended to be an app that users could use to either plan a room layout <i>or</i> shop for furniture, as evident in the separate "Plan" and "Shop" tabs in the tab bar.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>User Testing</h1>
        <p>User testing was conducted with the goal of determining whether or not the planning and shopping process was intuitive. However, users were confused about the layout of the Home page and about the split user flows between planning and shopping.</p>
        <img src="images/Inhance/userTesting.gif" class="screen">
        <br>

        <h1>User Flow</h1>
        <p>In order to better plan the app views, the following user flow was generated after user testing with various iterations:</p>
        <img src="images/Inhance/userFlow.jpg" class="wideImage">
        <br>
        <p>When simplified as seen in the user flow below, the final process involves the user first getting through the onboarding process and signing up. Then, the user will plan their room layout, at the same time choosing and shopping for furniture as they add them to their virtual room. Finally, the user will purchase the furniture at checkout.</p>
        <img src="images/Inhance/userFlowSimple.png" class="wideImage">
        <br><br>

        <h1>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>Taking into consideration the results and suggestions from user testing, the planning and shopping processes were combined, and the view layouts were changed accordingly. The high-fidelity visual design of the app was designed to follow iOS guidelines, as seen in the wireframes below.</p>

        <h1>Final Prototype</h1>
        <p>Using Adobe XD, a final colored prototype was created with animations and images to make the prototype feel like a realistic, polished app.</p>
