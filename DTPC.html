        <p>This project involved the restructuring and redesign of a nonprofit organization's website,
        namely that of the Desert Tortoise Preserve Committee (DTPC). DTPC dedicates itself to saving the
        endangered desert tortoise.</p>
        <p><b>My Role:</b> UX/UI Designer
        <br><b>Tools Used:</b> Adobe XD, Photoshop, Illustrator, InVision, Miro/RealTimeBoard, Trello
        <br><b>Timeframe:</b> 2 weeks</p>
        <br>

        <h1>The Problem: <span class="weblink"><a href="http://www.tortoise-tracks.org/wptortoisetracks/" target="_blank">http://www.tortoise-tracks.org/</a></span></h1>

        <img src="images/TortoiseTracks/oldWebsite.png" class="wideImage">
        <p>The main issue with DTPC's website is the lack of call-to-action for users.
            Although there is a donate button at the top of the page and the navigation is decent, it is unclear
            from the homepage what the priorities of the organization are and the actions visitors to the site could take.
            Users also may not feel comfortable donating their money to an organization that doesnâ€™t show how they spend their funds. In addition, the overall visual design of the website could be greatly improved to improve credibility.
        </p>
        <br>


        <h1>The Solution</h1>
        <p>The DTPC website should highlight the allocation of its funds and utilize a more inviting design with
            prominent calls to action to entice users to donate, volunteer, or learn more about the mission.</p>
        <img src="images/TortoiseTracks/newWebsite.png" class="wideImage">
        <br>


        <h1>User Research</h1>
        <p>User interviews and surveys were conducted in order to gain insight into how users contribute to nonprofit
            organizations, namely through donating or volunteering, in addition to what website features factor into their decision to contribute.</p>
        <img src="images/TortoiseTracks/researchData.png" class="wideImage">
        <p>Results showed that all users primarily donate to nonprofits due to a lack of time for volunteering, and that
            visual design, transparency and credibility play a major role into whether or not they contribute. Therefore, it is important that users have an emotional connection to the cause through transparency and credibility. Users should be able to see where money is going and the website should be welcoming and look professional.</p>
        <br>


        <h1>User Persona</h1>
        <p>Using data from the interviews and survey responses, the following persona was generated to stay oriented towards user needs and frustrations throughout the design process.</p>

        <br><br>


        <h1>Sketches and Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>With focus on a user flow that involves donating and volunteering, the following wireframes were made for both a desktop and mobile version of the website.</p>

        <br>

        <h1>User Testing</h1>
        <p>User testing was conducted with the goal of allowing the user to explore the website and ensuring that the
            donation process is straightforward and easy to understand. Overall, the process was fairly straightforward to users, with most of the changes involving the visual design and consistency across pages. The donation process was changed, however, such that the donation button leads directly to a donation form to make the process more efficient.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>Style</h1>
        <p>When creating high-fidelity wireframes, an overall style was planned out to keep pages consistent. Rather than using green colors, which are commonly associated with tortoises, warm tones were used to imitate the mood of a California desert, where desert tortoises inhabit. In addition, sandy textures were used for both the redesigned logo and in backgrounds throughout the pages to further imitate a desert aesthetic. The fonts chosen are commonly used in outdoors-related graphics and fit well with the desired theme.</p>

        <br><br>

        <h1>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h1>
        <p>Taking into consideration the results from user testing, several pages from the website were reconstructed with visual design and consistency as priority. Major focus was especially put onto the home page, ensuring that there were clear call-to-actions for the users and that the mission and accomplishments of the organization were displayed to promote credibility.</p>

        <h1>Final Prototype</h1>
        <p>The final prototype makes use of the generated wireframes and features responsive design for mobile and desktop browsers.</p>
